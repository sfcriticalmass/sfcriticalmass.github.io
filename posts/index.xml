On Tuesday, April 26, the SF Board of Supervisors voted to pass Mayor London Breed&amp;rsquo;s plan, with ammendments to ensure accesibility and equity.
To celebrate, I am proposing a route thru the &amp;ldquo;JFK Promenade&amp;rdquo; which also traverses other important bike routes still requiring serious people-first safety improvements: Market St, Valencia St, The Wiggle, and The Great Walkway.</description></item></channel></rss>
