# A Route To Celebrate Car-Free JFK

JFK Drive in Golden Gate Park is now permanently car-free! On Tuesday, April 26,
the SF Board of Supervisors voted to pass Mayor London Breed's plan, with
ammendments to ensure accesibility and equity.

To celebrate, I am proposing a route thru the "JFK Promenade" which also
traverses other important bike routes still requiring serious people-first
safety improvements: Market St, Valencia St, The Wiggle, and The Great Walkway.

Then via Church -> The Wiggle -> Fell to JFK Drive in Golden Gate Park. Finally continuing onto the Great Walkway (Upper Great Highway)." >}}

To that end, I am reviving the classic Critical Mass tradition of "xerocracy,"
i.e. leadership through photocopied leaflets, at least for today. I figure it's
a fitting first post for this new site and a way to pay homage to SF Critical
Mass's founders and history. As a newcomer and outsiders who's greatly enjoyed
Critical Mass since first coming less than a year ago, I've spent a good amount
of time thinking about Critical Mass's present and future role in San Francisco.
And I'm very optimisitic; I think the future is promising.

# The Promising Future of Critical Mass

I recently talked with one of the original founders (Hugh D'Andrade) and he
echoed a bit of a curious cynicism also found in the old [sfcriticalmass.org](https://www.sfcriticalmass.org/)
blog posts of decades past. That SF Critical Mass has lost its political
relevance and deservedly earned a reputation as a band of
confrontation-seekers. The most recent dot org blog post directly about SF
Critical Mass is from August 31st, 2013; pessimistically titled ["Lost Etiquette, Growing Incoherence"](https://www.sfcriticalmass.org/2013/08/31/lost-etiquette-growing-incoherence/).
In the most recent June 5, 2020 post ["George Floyd Memorial Ride"](https://www.sfcriticalmass.org/2020/06/06/george-floyd-memorial-ride/),
critical mass originator [Chris Carlsson](https://twitter.com/Nowtopian) laments:

In many ways Carlsson is right. In the last decades the political roles that
SF Critical Mass perhaps held have transfered on to other organizations.
The [SF Bike Coalition](https://sfbike.org/) seems to have gained some teeth
and, along with newer organizations such as [Kid Safe SF](https://kidsafesf.com/),
[Walk SF](https://walksf.org/), [SafeStreetRebel](https://www.safestreetrebel.com/),
etc., were instrumental in Car-Free JFK's success.

Meanwhile bike parties (in [SF](https://sfbikeparty.wordpress.com/)
and [around](https://eastbaybikeparty.wordpress.com/) the [bay](https://www.sjbikeparty.org/))
have provided alternate large celebratory group rides for the past decade or
so. Although these rides are certainly Critical Mass-adjacent and do not exist
in a political vacuum (many people fighting for safer streets attend), they are
mostly apolitical. Interestingly, when I first rode with Critical Mass it did
not feel any more politically principled than Bike Party---it seemed to just be
a Bike Party but with a bit less music and a bit more chaos.

{{< image src="/images/2021-11-12_ebbp.jpg" caption="A slice of East Bay Bike Party gathering at West Oakland BART on November 12, 2021." >}}

SF Critical Mass attendance is also certainly lower than decades ago, with
counts in the several dozens rather than several thousands. When I first
attended I was surprised by how old the demographic was, and that perhaps I
(in my mid 20s) was the youngest person there. But that's not so surprising
knowing that SF Critical Mass will be celebrating it's _thirtieth_ anniversary
in September of this year, 2022. But that is no excuse: Carlsson admits in the
[August 2013 post](https://www.sfcriticalmass.org/2013/08/31/lost-etiquette-growing-incoherence/),
"It’s not exactly a revelation to speak about how poorly we Critical Massers
have managed to transmit our culture to the new generation(s) over the past
decade and a half." There he was mainly referring to etiquette, but now it
certainly applies to attracting new massers at all.

But the current state of Critical Mass is a great opportunity and cause for
optimism. The current groups of 50-100 are stil enough to form a safe, fun
critical mass of bikes (and better than thousands for meeting new friends!).
And I don't see people seeking confrontation trying to fight cars. Mostly just
smiles and waves to and from curious onlookers.

Of course no action takes place in a vacuum: reclaiming the streets on bike is
no doubt political. But beyond that, on the ride I've met many friends fighting
for positive change in San Francisco, especially among the younger generation.
It isn't as outwardly visible as the pamphletting (though that seems to be
coming back!) but it's gotten me to participate in bike actions and the
bureaucratic process.

As Critical Mass contiues, we (the massers) can make it an even better force
for good. Nowadays I don't think Critical Mass has much of a bad reputation...
or in fact much reputation at all. Many think it a relic of the past (if they
are even aware of it at all). Including the founders, who have left the
Critical Mass accounts mostly abandoned. But no, it's still here, it's
a lot of fun, come join us! Hope to see you at SF Critical Mass!
