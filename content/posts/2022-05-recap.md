About a hundred people attended Critical Mass this May 27th. We left
Embarcadero Plaza at 6:30 pm sharp, headed down Market St to Valencia and up to
Dolores Park for the first stop. Local legend [Backwards Brian](https://www.instagram.com/backwards_brian/)
made an appearance but was unfortunately stopped by a flat tire after the first
stop.

We continued down through the Mission and back around Oracle Park where
[SFSU's commencement ceremony](https://commencement.sfsu.edu/commencement-2022-may-27-oracle-park-sfsu-grad)
was taking place for our second stop.

The last leg continued along the Embarcadero around to the final stop at the Aquatic Park Bleachers below
Ghirardelli Square. Total distance was about 12.5 miles, though several of us
continued as a group southbound on Polk St.
