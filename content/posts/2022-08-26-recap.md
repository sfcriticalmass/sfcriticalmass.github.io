This was an absolutely fantastic classic ride across the city and back. Thank
you to everyone who came, each ride seems to be bigger than the last as we
approach the 30th anniversary next month. We rode out at 6:45 pm up Market St
and through The Wiggle. With more than enough bikes we took over the Fell
Expressway and continued on to the Golden Gate Park Bandshell Accessible
Parking lot for our first break.

After about 25 minutes we continued onward to the beach! Rather than the normal
Car-Free *MLK* route, we cruised down the car-ed portion of JFK past Dutch
Windmill to reach the beach. Dense fog and light drizzle filled the air, lit up
by bike lights, creating an ethereal atmosphere. We continued south on the long
beautiful Great Walkway, closed to cars for the weekend, and reached the second
stop at the south end of Ocean Beach at Sloat Blvd.

After another 25 minute break we continued back, retracing our wheels up the
Great Walkway, but opting to take the usual Car-Free MLK route up through
Golden Gate Park. We still had enough mass to take Oak Street despite the extra
lane. We continued back down The Wiggle and down Sanchez Street for our final
stop at Dolores Park, arriving just before 10pm. The total ride was 3 hours 15
minutes over 19 miles.
