The tunnel ride! We set out at around 6:45pm and headed via Market up through
both the Stockton and Broadway tunnels with Chinatown in between. Both tunnels
were uphill, so we turned
around and cruised back down through them. A total of four tunnel traversals
in the first half hour! We then continued along a relatively standard route,
along Market to Valencia and up to Mission Dolores Park for a rest stop.

We continued through The Wiggle and along Fell to Hippie Hill in Golden Gate
Park. Then turned around and headed west along Slow Page Street, back down to
Market and the Ferry building. The last few riders continued along the
Embarcadero to the ballpark for the ending of the [Giants game](https://www.espn.com/mlb/game/_/gameId/401355713).

Thank you to those who brought music!
