of each month&amp;rsquo;s ride. So here&amp;rsquo;s how the April 29 ride from last week went.
All things considered, the planned route worked better than expected! Many
people peeled off early but a handful of us completely a full 16 mile route
from Embarcadero Plaza to the Greay Walkway in about 3.5 hours.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>April JFK Promenade Route + Reflections</title><link>https://sfcriticalmass.com/posts/jfk-promenade-xerox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfcriticalmass.com/posts/jfk-promenade-xerox/</guid><description>A Route To Celebrate Car-Free JFK JFK Drive in Golden Gate Park is now permanently car-free! On Tuesday, April 26, the SF Board of Supervisors voted to pass Mayor London Breed&amp;rsquo;s plan, with ammendments to ensure accesibility and equity.
To celebrate, I am proposing a route thru the &amp;ldquo;JFK Promenade&amp;rdquo; which also traverses other important bike routes still requiring serious people-first safety improvements: Market St, Valencia St, The Wiggle, and The Great Walkway.</description></item><item><title>Connect</title><link>https://sfcriticalmass.com/connect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfcriticalmass.com/connect/</guid><description>SF Critical Mass has no leaders, so every social media profile (and this website!) is unofficial.
